    <p>
        Isaac Newton, in full Sir Isaac Newton,<mark>(born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New Style],
         Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England-died March 20 [March 31], 1727, London)</mark>, English physicist and 
         mathematician, who was the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. 
         In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours 
         into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, 
         his three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of 
         the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics, he was the original discoverer of 
         the infinitesimal calculus. Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica 
         <mark>(Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687)</mark> was one of the most important single works in 
         the history of modern science.

<h2><u><b><em><font color ="#345DB7" size="5">Newton's laws of motion:</font></em></b></u></h2>

<p>
    Three statements describing the relations between the forces acting on a body and the motion of the body, 
    first formulated by English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton, which are the foundation of 
    classical mechanics.
</p>

<h2><u><b><em><font color="#700646" size="4">Newton's first law: the law of inertia</font></em></b></u></h2>

<p><strong><pre>1. Newton's first law states that if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, 
    it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force.
</pre></strong>
</p>

<h2><u><b><em><font color="#0D8A07" size="4">Newton's second law: F = ma</font></em></b></u></h2>
<p><strong><pre>2. Newton's second law is a quantitative description of the changes that a force can produce on 
    the motion of a body. It states that the time rate of change of the momentum of a body is equal in both 
    magnitude and direction to the force imposed on it.</pre></strong></p>

    <h2><u><b><em><font color="#B2A50A" size="4">Newton's third law: the law of action and reaction</font></em></b></u></h2>
<p><strong><pre>3. Newton's third law states that when two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another 
    that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The third law is also known as the law of action and 
    reaction.</pre></strong></p>
